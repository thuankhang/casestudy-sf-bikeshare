# Casestudy: San Francisco bike share network 

This project aims to evaluate the evolution of the network between 2014 and 2015 and identify critical stations or routes across five cities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

# Data

Data were collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share).

I only use station data([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thuankhang/casestudy-sf-bikeshare/refs/heads/main/data/SF-bikeshare-station-info.csv)), and trip data from `Monday 7 July 2014 to Sunday 13 July 2014` ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thuankhang/casestudy-sf-bikeshare/refs/heads/main/data/SF-bikeshare-1-week-2014-07.csv)) and `Monday 6 July 2015 to Sunday 12 July 2015`([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thuankhang/casestudy-sf-bikeshare/refs/heads/main/data/SF-bikeshare-1-week-2015-07.csv))
